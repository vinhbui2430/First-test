# ML model for weather-prediction

Purpose of this project is to predict the temperature using different algorithms like *linear regression, random forest regression, and Decision tree regression*. The output value should be numerically based on multiple extra factors like maximum temperature, minimum temperature precipitation, humidity, cloud cover and pressure.

# USE OF ALGORITHMS: 

There are different methods of foreseeing temperature utilizing Regression and a variety of Functional Regression, in which datasets are utilized to play out the counts and investigation. To Train, the calculations 80% size of information is utilized and 20% size of information is named as a Test set. For Example, if we need to anticipate the temperature of Hanoi, India utilizing these Machine Learning calculations, we will utilize 8 Years of information to prepare the calculations and 2 years of information as a Test dataset. The as opposed to Weather Forecasting utilizing Machine Learning Algorithms which depends essentially on reenactment dependent on Physics and Differential Equations, Artificial Intelligence is additionally utilized for foreseeing temperature: which incorporates models, for example, Linear regression, Decision tree regression, Random forest regression. To finish up, Machine Learning has enormously changed the worldview of Weather estimating with high precision and predictivity. What's more, in the following couple of years greater progression will be made utilizing these advances to precisely foresee the climate to avoid catastrophes like typhoons, Tornados, and Thunderstorms.

# METHODOLOGY

The dataset utilized in this arrangement has been gathered from Kaggle, named [Vietnam weather data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vanviethieuanh/vietnam-weather-data) from which we have filtered and chosen the data for “Hanoi City”. The dataset was created by keeping in mind the necessity of such historical weather data in the community. 

# Multiple Linear Regression: 

This regression model has high mean absolute error, hence turned out to be the least accurate model. Given below is a snapshot of the actual result from the project implementation of multiple linear regression. 

# Decision Tree Regression: 

This regression model has medium mean absolute error, hence turned out to be the little accurate model. Given below is a snapshot of the actual result from the project implementation of multiple linear regression. 

# Random Forest Regression: 
This regression model has low mean absolute error, hence turned out to be the more accurate model. Given below is a snapshot of the actual result from the project implementation of multiple linear regression.
